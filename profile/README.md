With its mobile-ready design, BrowserBox ensures consistent protection across all devices, keeping your operations secure and efficient wherever you are.

## **Why Choose BrowserBox?**

BrowserBox provides a secure, isolated browsing environment that helps organizations mitigate risks while maintaining productivity. It is especially suited for industries like defense, health research, and government where data security and compliance are paramount.

### **Unmatched Security and Compliance**

BrowserBox isolates web content in a remote environment, preventing potential threats from reaching your network. By executing web content in a secure, virtualized container, BrowserBox protects against:
- **Web-borne malware and ransomware**
- **Zero-day exploits**
- **Infected downloads and malicious links**

This setup makes BrowserBox an ideal solution for organizations needing to ensure compliance with strict security standards, including Zero Trust architectures.

### **Flexibility for Secure Embedding and Compliance**

BrowserBox can be seamlessly embedded within other web applications, bypassing traditional iframe restrictions. This allows organizations to integrate secure, remote browsers into their existing platforms, ensuring that users can interact with content without exposing the underlying infrastructure.

Additionally, BrowserBox can "wrap" local tabs in a secure remote browser environment, offering an extra layer of security for sensitive applications. This feature helps prevent data exfiltration, unauthorized downloads, and protects the source code of your web apps from exposure.

### **CloudTabs Integration**

BrowserBox also powers <a href=https://browse.cloudtabs.net>CloudTabs</a>, our SaaS offering that provides a streamlined, scalable solution for organizations that require remote browser isolation across their operations.

### **Source-available on GitHub** 

BrowserBox is proudly source-available, allowing organizations to vet the code thoroughly and ensure it meets their security and compliance standards. By making the source code available, BrowserBox minimizes supply chain risks, offering transparency that closed-source solutions can't match. This openness empowers your security teams to perform in-depth audits, integrate custom enhancements, and trust that your web browsing infrastructure is as secure as possible.
